# üéÆ Tenacity Recode

[Switch to ‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](README_CN.md)

## üß© Client Information

This client is based on the [zitalem/Tenacity](https://github.com/zitalem/Tenacity) Recode, originally an open source hacked client for Minecraft.

Compared to Tenacity 5.1, we have made the following improvements:

- üîß **Higher LWJGL Version**: Better optimization experience
- ‚òï **JDK 18**: Support for more modern syntax
- üßπ **Removed Unused APIs**: Such as Internet Store, Spotify, Kinggen (significantly reduces size and improves performance, while keeping the Script system ‚Äî something other JDK 18 forks cannot do)
- üë§ **Optimized AltManager**: Retains original UI, enhanced Microsoft login logic
- üîÅ **Updated ViaMCP**: Supports the latest Minecraft versions
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Stronger EventManager**: Uses [cubk1/EventManager](https://github.com/cubk1/EventManager), simpler syntax, better performance
- üà∂ **Own UnicodeFontRenderer**: Handwritten, no AI, no plagiarism, outstanding performance
- üöÄ **FPSBooster / FastLoader**: Startup speed compressed to about 5 seconds and improves game FPS
- üåê **I18N Multilingual System**: Supports internationalization
